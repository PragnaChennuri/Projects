This Hangman game challenges the user to guess a word by making guesses within a limited number of attempts. If the user fails to guess the word within the allotted guesses, they lose. However, if they successfully guess the word, they win. <br>

This game utilizes programming concepts such as:
- Utilization of the random module to select a random word from a predefined list. <br>
- Implementation of while loops to maintain the game flow. <br>
- Utilization of for loops to initialize the word. <br>
- Integration of external modules, such as 'hangman_art' and 'word_list,' to access ASCII art and word data. <br>
