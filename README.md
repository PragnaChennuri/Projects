## Project Portfolio

This repository contains a list of all the projects I have worked on, spanning various types of projects. I'll be updating it periodically as I work on new projects.

Feel free to explore the projects listed below:

- **Project 1: Tip Calculator(Python)** - A python program that calculates the tip based on the responses given by the user

- **Project 2: Treasure Island Game(Python)** - A treasure island game where the user is presented choices. Based on their answer, the user will either find the treasure or they will face various challenges and dangers.

- **Project 3: Rock Paper Scissor Game (Python)** - A classic game of rock, paper, scissors. Users input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly selects one as well. The winner is then determined based on the comparison of the user's choice and the computer's choice.

- **Project 4: Password Generator (Python)** - A password generator that allows users to customize the length and composition of their passwords. Users can choose the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their password and opt to randomize the order of characters.
