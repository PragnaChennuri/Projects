## Project Portfolio

This repository contains a list of all the projects I have worked on, spanning various types of projects. I'll be updating it periodically as I work on new projects.

Feel free to explore the projects listed below:

- Project 1: Tip Calculator(Python) - A simple python program that calculates the tip based on the responses given by the user

- Project 2: Treasure Island Game(Python) - A simple treasure island game where the user is presented choices. Based on their answer, the user will either find the treasure or they will face various challenges and dangers.
