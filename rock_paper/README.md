This project simulates the classic game of rock, paper, scissors. Users input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly selects one as well. The winner is then determined based on the comparison of the user's choice and the computer's choice.<br>

This game utilizes programming concepts such as:
- The random module for generating random computer choices.
- The list data type for storing the possible choices of rock, paper, and scissors.
